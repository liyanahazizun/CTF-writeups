## Challenge Information
```
Author: Jeffery John

Description:
People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Hints:
1. Checksums let you tell if a file is complete and from the original distributor. If the hash doesn't match, it's a different file/
2. You can create a SHA checksum of a file with `sha256sum <file>` or all files in a directory with `sha256sum <directory>/*`.
3. Remember you can pipe the output of one command to another with `|`.
